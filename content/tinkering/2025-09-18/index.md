# Problem

Sometime ago - I've watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXug7Kb3p4I) on Hidden 3D Inside Google Maps,
where it displayed the interior of restaurants in 3D

Quite naturally, my curious self wanted to take a look into and create one myself.

# Solution

After a couple of days of head scratching, 
I've finally did it and created a 3D model of my room: [my-room.marcuschiu.com](https://my-room.marcuschiu.com)

[![My 3DGS Room](assets/my-room.png)](https://my-room.marcuschiu.com)

# How it's Done

This article shows how to convert a bundle of 2D images into a 3D SOG file.

Since this technology is relative new and is booming with new research most of the tools are in fluctuations.
I've been using command line tools not so much of IDE specifically built for 3DGS. I assume using an IDE would be
much user-friendly. Anyways, I've stuck with command line and the rest of this article shows the pipeline 
I've ended up using.

# 0. Prerequisites

Install `conda` see: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html

# 1. Take Pictures of Thing for 3D Reconstruction

https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/gaussian-splatting-guide/

Create a directory `./images` to store all the images.

# 2. Colmap (for Feature Extraction, etc)

Install Colmap

```shell
conda create -n colmap python=3.9 -y
conda activate colmap

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
conda install -y -c conda-forge colmap
```

Use `colmap` to extract features from `./images`, then create sparse 3D maps, followed by dense 3D maps:

```shell
mkdir colmap_output
colmap feature_extractor --database_path colmap_output/database.db --image_path ./images
colmap exhaustive_matcher --database_path colmap_output/database.db
mkdir -p colmap_output/sparse
colmap mapper --database_path colmap_output/database.db --image_path ./images --output_path colmap_output/sparse
mkdir -p colmap_output/dense
colmap image_undistorter \
  --image_path ./images \
  --input_path colmap_output/sparse/0 \
  --output_path colmap_output/dense \
  --output_type COLMAP
mkdir -p colmap_output/dense/sparse/0
mv colmap_output/dense/sparse/*.bin colmap_output/dense/sparse/0
```

The data in `./colmap_output/dense` will be used in the next tool.

# 3. Gaussian Splatting

Install gaussian splatting tool:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting.git
cd gaussian-splatting/
pip install ./submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization
pip install ./submodules/simple-knn
pip install ./submodules/fused-ssim
conda install -c conda-forge plyfile
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install tqdm
```

Use it to train on the colmap output:

```shell
python train.py -s `../colmap_output/dense`
```

Your splat model `point_cloud.ply` will be under the `output` directory

```
output/
└── my_scene/
├── point_cloud.ply   ✅ (this is your splat model)
├── cfg_args          (training config)
├── ckpt_XXXX.pth     (checkpoints)
```

# 4. Edit the PLY file (optional)

- Go to https://superspl.at/editor/, import your splat model, edit, then export.
- or use https://www.realityscan.com/

# 5. Convert PLY into SOG

There are 2 ways to do this:

- https://github.com/playcanvas/splat-transform - newer but fails at [SegFault Bug](https://github.com/playcanvas/splat-transform/issues/49)
- https://github.com/playcanvas/sogs - deprecated but still works as of Sept 2025

# 5a Convert PLY into SOG (`splat-transform` tool)

SKIP THIS if [SegFault Bug](https://github.com/playcanvas/splat-transform/issues/49) is not fixed.

Install nodejs

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm --version
nvm install node
```

Install Splat Transform tool:

```shell
npm install -g @playcanvas/splat-transform
```

Use it to convert PLY to SOG

```shell
# Convert to SOG bundled format
splat-transform input.ply output.sog

# Convert to SOG unbundled format
splat-transform input.ply output/meta.json
```

# 5b Convert PLY into SOG (`sog-compress` tool)

Install `sogs-compress` tool:

```shell
conda create -n sog-compress python=3.9 -y
conda activate sog-compress

pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install cupy-cuda12x
pip install torchpq
pip install git+https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/PLAS.git
pip install git+https://github.com/playcanvas/sogs.git
```

Use it to compress PLY into Unbundled SOG:

```shell
sogs-compress --ply your_ply_file.ply --output-dir directory_to_store_images_and_metadata
```
