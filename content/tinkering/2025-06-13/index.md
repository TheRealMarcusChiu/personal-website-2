+++

For some reason there is an issue with running qBittorrent as a SystemD service on Ubuntu Server 24.04. 

Here is how I've done it.

# Install qbittorrent-nox

```shell
sudo apt install qbittorrent-nox
```

# Initial Run and Password Setup

make note of username (this will be used in Systemd Setup):

```shell
whoami
```

Run qbittorrent as user:

```shell
qbittorrent-nox
```

Make note of the username and password in console output as shown below:

```console

```

Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in browser, and login.

# Setup Systemd Service

Create a new service file

```shell
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/qbittorrent-nox.service
```

add the following contents into service file

```ini
[Unit]
Description=qBittorrent Command Line Client
After=network.target
 
[Service]
Type=forking
User=USERNAME_HERE  <---------------------- replace with username fromwhoami
Group=USERNAME_HERE <---------------------- replace with username fromwhoami
UMask=007
ExecStart=/usr/bin/qbittorrent-nox -d --webui-port=8080
Restart=on-failure
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Execute the following commands

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable qbittorrent-nox
sudo systemctl start qbittorrent-nox
sudo systemctl status qbittorrent-nox
```

Go back to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). You should be able to login with your new username password.
