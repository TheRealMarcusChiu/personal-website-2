# Proxmox Cluster

In this post I will go over setting up a Proxmox Cluster on my 3 Intel NUCs in my [homelab rack](/tinkering/2024-08-26/).

This will allow my servers to run in [high availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability) just in case one NUC goes down.

# Download Proxmox ISO and Create USB Boot Device

Download and install: https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment

I've downloaded the ISO file and used [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to create the USB boot medium.

# Post Installation Script

Once Proxmox was installed on each of the three machines, we will run one of the post install scripts.

This script removes the subscription nag, and among other things. 

Since we are configuring a cluster - we will not disable High Availability.

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/tools/pve/post-pve-install.sh)"
```
