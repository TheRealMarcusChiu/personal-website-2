Beauty, in its broadest sense:

- refers to the qualities of a person or thing
  that are pleasing to the senses and evokes a sense of enjoyment or appreciation
- is the quality of being pleasing to the senses or mind

Perhaps before we can understand good - we should explore what ultimate values do we find beauty in.
- goodness, truth, justice, forgiveness

For an odd reason — I believe the ultimate beauty has its beginnings in goodness.

What is goodness? A Google definition says:
- "the quality of being morally good or virtuous"
- "the beneficial or nourishing element of food"

Goodness is tied with morality. Side thought - beauty has another term aesthetics, then tied with ethics.
Wittgenstein mean by “ethics and aesthetics are one” in the Tractatus


We say a grape is good when it is sweet, and bad when it is sour.
