+++

A guy at the gym was trying to do a muscle up. He almost had it and I happen to be nearby.
He asked me if I could do a muscle-up. I'm like NO (it's damm hard) but I began explaining it's all in the technique.
He said, "show me what you mean".

I got up the pull-up bar and then ripped out a muscle-up... surprised the **** out of me -
I didn't think I was able to do it, I was training weighted pull-ups for the past couple months not knowing I could already do one..........

I wish I had a video lol
