# Chasing Happiness

If you die, your job will be posted before your obituary.

The only people who will remember you worked late are your kids and family.

# Life is Like Driving at Night in the Fog

Life is like driving at night in the fog.
You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.

It's not until you look back and realize that: the fog is just fog. It didn't hurt 
you, and nor will it hurt you. It isn't there to deceive you, and nor will it deceive 
you. All you have to do is to be patient and have hope: that it will clear, and that
you'll have the wherewithal to keep going.

The time in the car, as lonely as it can be, is part of the adventure itself.



# Friendships

For centuries, **friendships** was the paramount of relationships because **it was the one you chose**.

Until not too long ago, marriage was something that united kingdoms, clans, and dynasties.
You couldn't pick your spouse, you couldn't pick your business partners,
you couldn't pick your parents, you couldn't pick your
brothers, you couldn't pick your sisters, you couldn't pick your family.

But a friend is someone whom you can pick. And it's around this person - you become who you are.

&nbsp;

*Friends are the family you choose. Family are the friends you are stuck with*

# Give Thanks to the Fleas

{{< youtube 75P9BCb-OFU >}}

In The Hiding Place, Corrie and Betsie ten Boom end up giving thanks for the fleas in their barracks at Ravensbrück — and it becomes one of the most famous moments in the book.

Why they gave thanks for the fleas

After arriving at their new barracks, Betsie reminds Corrie of the Bible verse they read that morning:
“Give thanks in all circumstances.”
(1 Thessalonians 5:18)

Corrie says she cannot give thanks for the fleas — the place is swarming with them.
But Betsie insists, and eventually Corrie reluctantly thanks God for them.

The twist

Later, the sisters realize that the guards never enter their barracks because of the fleas.

Because of that:

The women can hold secret Bible readings,

Share prayers,

Offer encouragement freely,

And live with much less harassment than in other barracks.

Corrie concludes that the fleas — the thing she hated most — were actually protecting them.

The point of the story

The episode highlights one of the book’s central themes:
Sometimes blessings come disguised as suffering.
