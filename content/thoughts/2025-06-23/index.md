They say - "you can't trust yourself to know everything about yourself"

Which is why I was intrigued by `Dimensional Me`.

It's another other personality test lol

But it also contains other tests for:
- cognition
- values
- primary traits
- love styles
- love attitudes
- attachments styles
- interests
- lifestyle
- interaction styles
- secondary traits
- political idealogy
- sex attitudes
- conflicts styles
- coping styles

I tend to NOT trust these tests because it's you taking the test about yourself
and I don't trust myself to know everything about myself.
But it's always fun to read a makeshift description about yourself

Here's my results: https://www.dimensional.me/marcuschiu
