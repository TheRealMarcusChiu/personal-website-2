When Natalie talks about her depression after winning those bodybuilding competitions,
this is actually a somewhat known phenomenon called post-achievement depression 
(lots of other names for it, too). Lots of theories about this, but I think it makes 
sense that a driven person might mourn the death of a challenge that had motivated 
them for so long. Kinda like how Joker doesn't actually want to kill Batman, just
wants to antagonize him eternally.

I'm a touring musician, and her talk about the 'post-show depression' around 8:00 is
very similar to what a lot of musicians feel when they get off the road -- myself 
included. You work up to a tour/show for weeks or months, it happens, it's great, 
and then the next day, you're back working your day job invisible to the world. In a
backward way, it's almost better for it to go badly so you have something to work 
towards again. This is why continually having goals is important if that's the type 
of motivation you need. Some people will judge you, but some of us need a target to
aim for.
