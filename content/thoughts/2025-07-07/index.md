In christianity death is like sleep.

Sometimes i believe God has given us sleep to show us what death is like.
It is something NOT to be afraid of - but to be woken up from.

For example, when Jesus raised the girl from the dead, He said two words, "Talitha Cumi".
It is an Aramaic phrase meaning "Little girl, arise". This is an endearment term,
as if a Dad would say to his little daughter, 
"sweety - it's time to wake up". The sun shines brightly in through the window,
and the dad says, "sweety - wake up, it's time to start your day".

That is what death is like. Every one of us will have a last moment.
And when that time comes, your eyes will start to drift - darkness will set in - 
in the silence you'll hear, "wake up - my child".
A bright Light shines in through the window of your eyes.
And as everything starts to slowly focus - you'll see Him face to face.
Then you shall know fully, even as you were fully known.
