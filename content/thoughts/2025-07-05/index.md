Looking back on it all - from the beginning to the end of us - I've learned some things about myself that I didn't even know were possible.

I didn't realize how focused I can be in trying to understand her:
She is soft-spoken at first, prefers 1-on-1 hangouts over groups, but once well-acquainted she had this way of bantering, "spilling the tea", and making silly noises which she labels as "demon sounds".
She could get anxious in new groups, self-conscious about her hair when it's windy, her love-language is touch then quality-time, prone to love-bombing, easily attached - and fortunately aware of it.
She likes lego botanical sets, thin minimalistic metal bracelets, purses, perfumes, TikTok, and yarn-knitted clothes especially in the winter (a soft white one at the coffee shop, and a striped blue-gray one when we got pho).

Overtime, I started picking out gifts she'd like - even for her birthday 6 months in advance lol. I made her a bracelet with interchangeable Lego plates. So as we shared more experiences, a plate could be made for that shared memory. I've left one empty for her upcoming birthday.

But I remembered what she said about "love bombing". So I held back. Maybe, without realizing it, I was the one holding on to a bomb. Over a half-dozen gifts were left ungiven. I held back in several other ways. Although, there were times I've let some slip by.

I didn't realize how emotions could take reign over me. What hurt the most was seeing her beautiful eyes but this time with tears. I was numb. The next day my emotions flooded - I made up a lie and blame-shifted a fictitious person. My clouded judgement thought it would help but it turned out to be the proverbial final nail for her, perhaps the entire coffin itself.

Maybe I'll come across another gift again - and express the un-expressed
