“Let us make mankind in our image” – God

If the God of Christianity exists… Then He is not just a powerful God who created humanity to be in community, but He is a powerful God who is already in a community. It is only when God created mankind that His plurality was brought out. The Trinity – a mysterious concept – the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. It’s like they are in some kind of dance, wrapped up in a bosom. And in this dance they are able to: delight and be delighted, enjoy and be enjoyed, praise and be praised, love and be loved, and know and be known. So when God said “Let us make mankind in our image” it’s like He’s saying, “Let us make mankind be able to experience what We are able to give each Other”. So now we’re able to participate in this kind of dance; to see and be seen, to hear and be heard, and to know and be known. This is a gift – whether or not God exists – the ability to form relationships of all kinds: from parent-child relationships to sibling relationships, and friendships to romantic relationships. This is a gift – a beautiful gift – for all of us to enjoy.
