Been slacking on meditation. But for the past week I’ve been dwelling
on how one views the Law will have different reasons for obeying the 
law. When I think of the law, my first reaction is that it is something
to be obeyed instead of something to rely on. There’s nothing wrong 
with that. But for me, if it’s simply just something to obey, then when
I’m not doing it, I begrudgingly do it, and when I do do-it I think 
I’m more righteous than those who don’t do it. Iono where that lie 
came from: that one is holier if he or she does something holy. 
But anyway, I think it’s best to also view the law as something that 
you rely on. And the example that comes into my mind is food. Which is 
not surprising because I always think of food lol. We can delight in 
food, which is a blessing, but what happens when food stops being 
delightful? Do we stop eating? No, we still eat because our physical 
bodies rely on it. So in the same way we rely on the law. I don’t eat 
begrudgingly because I ought to do it I just do it because it is in my 
nature. And when I do eat, I don’t think of myself more righteous than
those who are not eating. In fact, a sane person would give them 
something to eat.
