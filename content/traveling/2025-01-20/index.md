Last week I’ve gone on a road trip with some buds. Here’s the synopsis of the trip:

- Phil Wickham concert at Texarkana, TX
- Rattlesnake Ridge Natural Area, Arkansas
- Hot Springs, Arkansas (didn’t get to try out hot springs bathhouse – note to self bring legit swimwear and sandals)
- Ruby’s Mexican Restaurant at Tyler, Texas (if you ever go there again – order Doblados de Birria)

Here’s some pictures
